# Airport
## Information Visualization on Airport and Routes Datasets Using Altair

The data is gotten from [OpenFlight](https://openflights.org/data.html)

## objectives

The goal of this project is to create  visuals that reveal and communicates insights from the dataset. The visuals will be used to reveal obvious insights, such as:

1. How many airports are in each country?
2. Which airports are the busiest?
3. What are the routes with the least stops between airports X and Y?

There are also some less obvious questions, such as:

    1. Are there any interesting patterns or trends in the data?
    2. What insight can we gain from multi-variate visualisations of the data?
    3. Which location has the densest flight connections?
    4. Which routes are likely to cause jet lags?
